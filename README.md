# Timer

The application runs based on the date selected by the user and then takes the GMT time of the region to start with.

Their is a provision of setting the threshold to 3 values (15, 30s, 45s) for marking the boundary of the laps.

The user can select a date that is greater than the current date and click the start button to start the timer.

Their is provision to pause and resume the timer.

When the timer is stopped a countdown summary is displayed below the timer that gives information about the timer and the
triggered laps.

You can use the spacebar to create new laps as when required and the timer is in running mode.

To delete a lap you can use the delete/backspace key to remove the current lap and merge in to the previous lap.

The timer show a visual when any of the currently running lap exceeds the threshold.

The timer saves the current state of the application when refreshed or returning back to the application,
given the timer was in a running state when either of the two chasnges were triggered (refresh/close and reopen)
